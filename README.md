## About the Company/Task:
Social Buzz is a fast growing social media company that veered away from the traditional social media practice. They sought their own uniqueness by instead of the limited reactions to a post, they offered more allowing their users to too express their emotions to a post by a  wide varieties of emoji’s that vividly reflects that true state of mind. This, therefore, made Social Buzz’s growth faster than they had anticipated. They thus needed to understand their company data in order to adapt quickly to its global scale and rapid expansion.

Accenture, therefore, was given a 3 month POC focusing on the following tasks:

· An audit of Social Buzz's big data practice

· Recommendations for a successful IPO

· Analysis to find Social Buzz's top 5 most popular categories of content

## What is the business problem?

Social Buzz Media Company has over 100,000 posts per day 36,500,000 pieces of content per year! It becomes increasingly necessary that they need to capitalize on the huge amount of data and activities going on their platform. But how?

## The Business Task:
As a data analyst at Accenture (for the virtual internship job simulation program), I was tasked with no 3 task, “Analysis to find Social Buzz's top 5 most popular categories of content”, and to further provide other useful business insights from the company’s data.
## The Process:
1.	Data Understanding/sourcing: Data was gotten from the primary data source.

2.	Data Cleaning: 
•	Three datasets were loaded into Microsoft SQL Server Management  Studio 20

•	Null values where removed.

•	Data was checked for duplicate

•	Data types were correctly formatted

3.	Data Modelling: The three datasets where joined together on common columns using inner joins to form a single dataset for easy and detailed analysis.

4.	Data Analysis: Data was analyzed to answer the business question “Top 5 most popular categories of content”. Also further insights where derived from it.

## Uncover Insights From the Data: 
#### Top 5 Content Category: 

Animals, Science, Healthy living, Technology, and Food appeared in the top 5 content category

While there are not much difference in the percentage of popularity score between the rests of the 4 top categories, “Animals” give a margin in its popularity. This shows that most conversations are centered on nature on Social Buzz platform. While the rest categories are close in the popularity score, it could be inferred that the demographic anchoring this discussion are well learned, nature-lovers and apt to continuous learning. With “Food” and “Healthy living”, “Science” and “Technology” making up the top 5, one will categorically argue on the above assumption.
## FUTHER INSIGHTS INTO THE DATA
#### Post with the Most Reaction:

It is not surprising that “Animals” post being the topmost has most reactions.

These reactions varied by their reaction types, from scared to disgust, love, super-love, hate. This goes to show the kind of emotions that nature evokes and that nature is such fascinating that it holds the most engagement for users in this platform.

#### Posts by Months:

The month of May had the most post. This could be as a result that “Animals” category will inherently contribute most to the posts as May is seen as the transition from spring to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, with longer days,  warmer weather, and blooming flowers. Also May is associated with festivities and celebrations in many cultures. Thus posts about nature, food, and contents relating to healthy living/lifestyle living will be curated more to match the energy of the month.
# RECOMMENDATIONS:
•	That Social Buzz add age and gender demographic to their data to enable further insights into their user base.

•	That Social Buzz capitalize on the traffic of their top 5 categories to tailor adverts in that direction.

•	That they also reach out to products/companies that will need the traffic of their top 5 content categories in order to generate income for their platform.

•	That they also make their algorithm to promote other categories aside the top 5 in order to avoid selection bias which if not done will affect their platform negatively in the long run.
